# Elon Musk Chat Bot
### Purpose
- The purpose of this project was for COSC 310 "Software Engineering".
- We created a chatbot that can answer some questions about Elon Musk.
- We did not use any NLP libraries but we used a chain of if else statements that when a word is recognized from a sentence it will get the appropriate response from a 2D array.
